Modifications to make to existing code:
=======================================
+ ALL MODELS AND LIBRARY: Add Python bindings.  This should
	allow us to get rid of the GNU getopt dependence and
	provide better cross-platform capability. The Python
	dependence is not a big issue since KiCAD already
	depends on Python. Exposing the library to Python
	allows other users to create Python scripts to
	generate models.
+ DIP-N:
	+ expose parameters and routines
	+ allow control of which pins to create - for example a
		reed relay may be in a DIP-24 package but only
		have 4 pins.
	+ rewrite the dip_pin class to exploit the Pin class
+ Resistors:
	+ expose parameters and routines, include general
		routines such as color code generators
+ Connectors:
	+ PCC: expose parameters and routines (low priority
		since there is only a single component)
	+ 4UCon Drawing 19950: expose parameters and
		routines


Possible new tools to add to the list:
======================================

Helix: Create a helical wire.
	+ The wire may be rectangular or circular
	+ The wire is coiled along an elliptical helix
		with a minimum of 6 vertices in the ellipse
	+ The wire will always coil in 1 dimension; rotating
		orthogonal to the helical axis will yield
		a wire with the opposite rotation
        + The wire has an X and Y dimension
        + The pitch of the helix must be >= the wire X dimension
        + The helix ends will terminate in a plane parallel to
		the helical axis
	+ The minimum coiling diameter is 2 x the wire's Y dimension;
		this would yield an extremely tightly wound coil
		which is rare in actual devices.

Paired vertices:
	Paired vertices allow the description of a fairly complex cross-section
	which can be extruded as circles and rectangles are extruded into wire
	(pin) sections. The surface described by a list of paired vertices may
	be rendered by rendering two sets of paired vertices at a time to form
	quadrilateral facets. Unlike circles and rectangles, paired vertices
	are not constrained to a plane. Facets may join two lists of paired
	vertices in the same way that facets may join two circles to form a tube.

Spheroid:
	Some packages may be marked with a dimple while BGA packages are studded
	with hemispheres on their bottom side - these are really all the same
	kind of feature but with different sides rendered visible. A hemispheroid
	shall be defined by a major and minor diameter, a depth, a minimum feature
	scaling factor, and number of polygons. The minimum scale factor is used
	to determine the size of the ellipse at the bottom of the hemispheroid.
	For simplicity the hemispheroid is called a Spheroid.

Text:
	Renders simple text strings as extrusions of a given depth, pensize, and
	character height. The font shall be a fixed-width font and shall resemble
	the typical font used on PCBs. Minimal character set shall include:
	A..Z  a..z , 0..9 . + -
