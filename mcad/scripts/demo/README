This directory contains demo python scripts for informative
purposes and for checking model features.

hdrdemo.py:  Demo and test for Genhdr(). Features to verify include:
 + beveled pin/beveled hole. Male headers must have a single pin
	piercing the header and must have holes of equal size on the
	top and bottom. The holes must be beveled if necessary to
	accommodate the pins.
 + rectangular pin: Pins may now be rectangular; no restrictions are
	placed on male headers, so male header pins may be rectangular.
	For female headers, the top and bottom may be different shapes;
	the allowed combinations are as follows:
	- bottom: rect, top: square
	- bottom: rect, top: circle
	- bottom: square, top: square
	- bottom: square, top: circle
	- bottom: circle, top: square
	- bottom: circle, top: circle
 + funnel depth: For female headers, circular funnels may be
	recessed (depth > 0), stand proud (depth < 0), or
	be flush (depth = 0).
