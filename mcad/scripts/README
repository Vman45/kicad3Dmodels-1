This directory contains various scripts to generate
VRML models.

demo: Contains a python script as a basic example of how
      to use the VRML tools.

    are generally parametric but some scripts may not be
    parametric and may generate only a single specialized model.

       and python scripts to generate a very large number of
       VRML models.
