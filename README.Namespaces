Namespaces are used to segregate grouped components. At the
moment the planned namespaces are:

kc3d: for all low-level operations shared between models

Other namespaces should be named after the class of components, for example:

kc3dresistor: for models related to resistors
kc3ddip: for models related to DIPs
kc3dconn: for models related to connectors [this namespace is not currently used]
