This source code requires CMake version 2.8 or greater for
configuration and a standards compliant C++ compiler with
the STLPort implementation of the C++ Standard Template
Libraries. Although many of the classes should be portable
across platforms, some source files such as the stand-alone
executable files depend on GNU getopt and thus require a
GNU build environment.

LINUX
=====
To configure, create the build directory within the top
level project directory and invoke CMake from the build
directory:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

The source can now be built and installed to the directory
../scripts/bin:
make install

The ../scripts directory contains a number of scripts for
running the various programs to generate VRML component
models, install the models in the ../mcad/vrml directory,
and package sets of models as tarballs.

At the moment the tools are not intended to be installed
into the system directories since they are of no great
use once they have been run to generate sets of models.
In the future the tools may be repackaged with Python
bindings to make it possible to use Python scripts to
create new component models.
