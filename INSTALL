These are preliminary instructions on building and installing the VRML tools
with a short guide on how to run the scripts to generate the currently
parameterized models.

Building:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Example install on Linux:
    make install DESTDIR=${HOME}

    will install all files within ${HOME}/usr/local.

Setting up the environment:
    To ensure that libraries can be found, set the following environment
variables as appropriate for the installation (example assumes
${HOME}/usr/local):

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH: must contain path to installed kc3d libraries.
        ex: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/usr/local/lib/kc3d
    PYTHONPATH: same as LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export PYTHONPATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    KC3DPATH: must point to the directory containing the VRML material
        appearance definitions. This environment variable is used by
        the binary executable parametric generators such as 'make19950'.
        ex: export KC3DPATH=${HOME}/usr/local/share/kc3d/appearances

    It may also be necessary to modify the PATH variable to include the
    directory of the binary executables:

    export PATH=${HOME}/usr/local/bin:${PATH}


Running all existing models:
    cd
    mkdir vrml_test
    cd vrml_test
    export VDIR=${HOME}/usr/local/share/kc3d/scripts/batch
    ${VDIR}/conn/generate.sh
    ${VDIR}/diode/generate.sh
    ${VDIR}/dipn/generate.sh
    ${VDIR}/resistor/generate.sh
    ${VDIR}/smt/generate.sh

    As of 8 Dec 2014 this generates 6736 models with a total disk
    usage of about 1.7GB.

====================
BUILDING ON WINDOWS:

The tools can currently be built and run on MSWindows with MSYS2 + MinGW64:


1. install msys2 and run the w64 console
2. synchronize the package repository:
    pacman -Sy
3. install gcc/g++/gdb/make
    * search for candidates:
    pacman -Ss gcc
    pacman -Ss gdb
    pacman -Ss make
    * install
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
4. install git and openssh:
    pacman -S bzr openssh
    pacman -S python
5.a If you downloaded the tarball then simply untar it to
    the directory 'models3d'
5.b If you are retrieving the source via git:
    cd && git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/kicad3dmodels/code models3d
6. install cmake:
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
7. install various build dependencies:
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-wxWidgets
    pacman -S  mingw-w64-x86_64-boost
8. Configure:
  cd ~/models3d
  mkdir build
  cd build
  /mingw64/bin/cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/mingw64/bin/g++.exe \
    -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=/mingw64/bin/mingw32-make \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="" \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON ..

9. Build and install the VRML modeling tools:
    mingw32-make.exe install DESTDIR=~/usr
    (NOTE: everything is installed in ${HOME}/usr)

10. Set up the environment:
    export PATH=/mingw64/bin:${HOME}/usr/bin:${PATH}
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mingw64/bin:${HOME}/usr/bin
    export PYTHONPATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export KC3DPATH=${HOME}/usr/share/kc3d/appearances

11. Create a directory to try out the tools:
    cd
    mkdir vrml
    cd vrml
    export VDIR=${HOME}/usr/share/kc3d/scripts/batch
    ${VDIR}/conn/generate.sh
    ${VDIR}/diode/generate.sh
    ${VDIR}/dipn/generate.sh
    ${VDIR}/resistor/generate.sh
    ${VDIR}/smt/generate.sh
